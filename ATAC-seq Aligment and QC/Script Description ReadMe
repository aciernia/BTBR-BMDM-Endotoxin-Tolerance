Command line scripts for the alignment and QC of BTBR and C57 ATAC-seq datasets. 
Main scripts are divided by strain: 
ode for making the BTBR genome from mm10 variant vcf files 

BTBRBtw2index.sh contains code for making the BTBR bowtie2 indexes for alignment of BTBR data with MMARGE.
C57Btw2index.sh contains code for C57 bowtie2 indexes 

checksum.sh checks fastq checksum

C57alignment_mmarge_array.sh contains alignment information etc for C57

BTBRalignment_mmarge_array.sh contains alignment information etc for BTBR (includes alignment to BTBR version of the genome using MMARGE and shifting back to mm10 standard coordinates).

shift_files_to_reference_textfiles.pl internal modified script used by MMARGE for coordinate shifting

ATAC_BAM_shifter_gappedAlign.pl  is a perl script for read shifting to account for the Tn5 cut sites: from here https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ATAC-seq/blob/master/auyar/ATAC_BAM_shifter_gappedAlign.pl

FilterFragmentSizeBam.sh Script to filter for nucleosome free reads < 147 bp

Peakcalling_homer_array.sh calls peaks using HOMER. uses pos2bedmod.pl

deeptools_SpearmanCorrl.sh makes correlation plots using deeptools for sample QC

merged_bigwigs_5_5_19.sh merges big wigs by sample group using merge_bigwig_server.sh

mm10.blacklist.bed bedfile with mm10 blacklist regions for removal 

LibraryQC.R R code for library QC analysis using ANOAV and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected postdocs.
