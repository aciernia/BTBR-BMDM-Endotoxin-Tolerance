Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from Fvb mice
Mus musculus
cell type: BMDM cells 7th day of differentiation
treatment LPS 10 ng/ml for 2hr
"Macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide LPS, 10 ng/ml"
"Bone marrow cells isolated from female Fvb mice were plated in 10 cm plates in 5ml of BM-medium (high glucose DMEM supplemented with 20% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum, 30% L929-conditioned medium, 1% glutamine, 1%, Pen/Strep, 0.5% Sodium Pyruvate, 0.1% _-mercaptoethanol). Cultures were fed with 2.5 ml of fresh medium every two days."
genomic DNA
All reads that maps uniquely to the genome with two or fewer mismatches were kept.
Peaks: analyses were performed using MACS (PMID: 18798982) with a bandwith of 150bp and a p-value threshold of 10^-5. p300 and H3K4me1 ChIPs were normalized against input DNA. PU.1 ChIPs were normalized against a theoric distribution of the same number of tags.
